## Step 2: Composing AI Workflows

Great work! Your first AI workflow is now functional. Next, let's see how to combine the `ai-inference` action with other actions to create meaningful AI workflows for your projects.

### üìñ Theory: Composing AI Workflows

AI adds the most value in Actions when you connect three pieces:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[üì• Context] --> B[ü§ñ AI Inference]
    B --> C[üì§ Impact]

    style A fill:#4fc3f7,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style B fill:#ffb74d,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style C fill:#ba68c8,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

- üì• **Context**: Gather data from outputs of other actions (e.g file contents, API results, or computed values) or `github` [event context](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts#github-context)
- ü§ñ **Inference**: Use the context to build a focused prompt for `actions/ai-inference` to analyze
- üì§ **Impact**: Pass the AI result to another action/script to create impact.

This pattern keeps workflows simple while handling judgment‚Äëheavy tasks that are hard to script deterministically.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create an issue analyzer workflow

1. Create `.github/workflows/issue-analyzer.yml` workflow on the `main` branch.

   Add the workflow metadata and permissions

   ```yaml
   name: Issue Analyzer

   on:
     issues:
       types: [opened]

   permissions:
     models: read
     issues: write
   ```

   This workflow will run whenever a new issue is opened with the permissions to access GitHub Models and to write new issue comments.

   > ‚ùó **Caution:** Copy the contents as provided, as this exact workflow name (`Issue Analyzer`) is required to progress to next steps of this exercise.

1. Now we'll create a job that uses the AI inference action.

   In this scenario we want to analyze the issue content to provide intelligent feedback and recommendations:

   This workflow introduces two new parameters:
   - **`system-prompt`**: Defines the AI's role and behavior - think of it as giving the AI specific instructions on how to act and respond
   - **`max-tokens`**: Sets the maximum length of the AI's response to ensure complete answers aren't cut off mid-sentence

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     analyze:
       name: AI Issue Analyzer
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Analyze issue with AI
           id: ai-response
           uses: actions/ai-inference@v2
           with:
             token: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
             max-tokens: 1000
             system-prompt: |
               You are a GitHub issue assistant. Your task is to analyze newly opened issues. 
               
               Provide concise, helpful suggestions, ask clarifying questions and identify any missing information that would help resolve the issue faster. 
               
               Always respond with ready-to-use markdown content (no code blocks) that can be posted directly as an issue comment. 
             prompt: |
               New issue was opened by {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}{% endraw %}
               Title: {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.title }}{% endraw %}
               Body:
               ---
               {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.body }}{% endraw %}
               ---
   ```

   > ü™ß **Note:** Notice how we are passing dynamic values from the `github` event context

1. Now we'll use the `ai-inference` `response` output to post a comment back to the issue to provide immediate feedback:

   ```yaml
   - name: Comment results on the issue
     uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v4
     with:
       token: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
       issue-number: {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.number }}{% endraw %}
       body: {% raw %}${{ steps.ai-response.outputs.response }}{% endraw %}

   ```

1. And we're done! Commit the file directly to the `main` branch, then open the **Actions** tab and confirm the workflow appears.

<details>
<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

- If the action does not appear in the **Actions** tab verify you put it in `.github/workflows/` directory with `.yml` extension

</details>

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Test the workflow

1. Navigate to the Issues tab and click **New issue**.

   Create an issue with any title and body you'd like, or use these examples:

   **Title example:**

   ```text
   Login form throwing 500 errors on mobile
   ```

   **Body example:**

   ```markdown
   Getting 500 errors when trying to log in on my phone. It works sometimes but not always.
   ```

1. Create the issue and observe your workflow running in the **Actions** tab.
1. When the workflow completes, you should see a new comment on the issue with the AI Issue analysis.

<details>
<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

- If the workflow didn‚Äôt run, confirm the trigger is `issues: [opened]` and you created a new issue (not edited an existing one).
- If the workflow failed to parse, check that the YAML indentation is correct and that all required fields are present.
